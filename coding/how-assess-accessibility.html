            <p>Anyway, I am going to assess Meakstown on 3 things. Ease of Access, Ease of Transportation, and Safety. Each of these things will be ranked from 1-10. 1 being, "Why on Earth did the cruel and merciless gods do this to me?" and 10 being "I can live a normal life!" 
                
                
            <p>Ease of Access being how easy it is to get into things, parks, shopping centres and all that jazz. Ease of Transportation is how easy it is to get around. I will be remarking on cracks in the pavement, ramps and more. Safety is pretty straightforward, I will be remarking on how safe it is to ride a wheelchair in Meakstown, I will mention how many times I fell (it's in double digits) and hills and gravity and stuff like that.</p>
