            <p>I am very privileged, I can walk, I'm ordinary sized, and I'm not encumbered with the horror of inevitable old age...yet. So I agree, there was no way I was gonna comment on stuff that I don't know at all. So that's why I rented a wheelchair from Mobility Direct for 4 weeks, just to drive around the area with it so I could know. And, holy shit is it hard to do, especially in Meakstown. I go into more detail in the Accessibility pages if you want to skip to the juicy stuff. But oh my God, they have a lot of work to do. 
            
            
            <p>These wheelchairs were not cheap. 4 weeks with a self-propelled wheelchair is 109.00 euro. But it was worth it. Without it, I would never know the stuff that disabled people go through. The smallest crack can be the most annoying thing in the world in one of these things. And in the run down, post-apocalyptic area of Meakstown, it's borderline unlivable. No wonder I don't see anyone in wheelchairs in this place!</p>
