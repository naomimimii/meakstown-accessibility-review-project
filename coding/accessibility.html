            <p>OK, ok, Meakstown and Charlestown is absolutely garbage regarding Ease of Access, Ease of Transportation and most importantly, Safety. There are cracks that even abled people will have trouble with, much less a disabled person! I can't count how many times I fell, (through no fault of my own by the way), on two hands during the 4 weeks. Almost everytime I fell, someone rushed over to me to try to help, which is nice, but I don't think disabled people should be relying on other people for the basic requirement of moving from point A to point B. Also, it was really embarrassing seeing them seeing me stand up and walk again and then I would have to tell them the project I was doing. And then they judge me. The only times where I didn't get help are when I was alone. Safety is unfortunately a <strong>3/10.</strong></p>
            
            
            <p>Well at least I can go to Dunnes in the Charlestown Shopping Centre, right? Well yeah, but it's not gonna be really easy. There is a ramp, but it is inconveniently placed at the far sides of the shopping centre entrance, so you'd have to go all the way to the corner just to get on the ramp. And I am not strong, I spend all of my time animating or playing games. It was very, very tiring. But presumably, that won't be an issue for people who are permanently disabled who must possess unmatched upper body strength. It was SO TIRING, my arms still hurt from it and I did it weeks ago. Furthermore there are a lot of ramps everywhere that people use for cars and parking but wheelchair users can use it to get onto the sidewalk. There are also gates to enter parks that are disabled friendly. Ease of Access is very prominent in Meakstown and Charlestown, but the rating is damaged due to the poor Safety. <strong>5/10.</strong></p>
            
            
            <p>How about Ease of Transportation? well some of the Dublin Bus stops are unfortunately placed on hills and narrow sidewalks, so people will have to get on the road to walk past you, or somehow materialise through bushes and trees that are placed next to the bus stop. It also means that you must hold the emergency brakes constantly which is very annoying. But that doesn't really matter, what matters is that the cracks are not only dangerous, they are actively preventing Ease of Transportation, which is obviously an issue. Even the tiniest cracks are annoying to get past, and there were a huge amount of gaping cracks in the pathway like it was a Mad Max movie. There was one path devoid of cracks and was very smooth, for bikes, and it was very very easy to traverse, and I like it that way, because then disabled people won't wanna pull their hair out of their heads. <strong>1/10.</strong></p>
