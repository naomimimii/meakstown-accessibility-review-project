            <p>Universal Design is, as quoted by the website Centre for Excellence in Unviersal Design, "-is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability."</p>
                
                
            <p>I'm 19, 5' 11, not neurodivergent (probably) and I'm not disabled. So I can't imagine how hard it must be for people who are far less fortunate than me. These people thought the same thing, but unlike me who didn't do anything about it, they made a Centre for Excellence in Universal Design.</p>
