            <p>Well, Meakstown is the place I live in. And it is really really....there. It's just there. The milkshakes are really good though, when they're not thrown at you. The Charlestown shopping centre is right beside Meakstown and is full of shops to help you accessorise, buy groceries for you and your pet, and buy meat! 
                
                
            <p>There's a butcher there that's always closed for some reason. The last time I saw it open was a few months ago. Weird. Anyway, The bus routes here can get you to Finglas Village all the way to DCU or Blanchardstown. I don't know why you would EVER go to DCU though, #TUDForLife, but the option is there. I've lived here for about 4 and a half years, ever since 3rd Year and it's pretty ok here. 
                
                
            <p>Again the kids are really annoying with their milkshakes. But other than that, it's pretty ok. There are also Chinese restaurants in Finglas that can get you a spice bag, and they are tasty. There's also a vet that treats animals, and they vaccinated Charlie, my cat. Which was nice because he really liked the veterinarian for some reason. She was really sweet though. Meakstown is pretty ok.</p>
