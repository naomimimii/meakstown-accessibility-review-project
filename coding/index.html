            <p>This website is about the very pretty me reviewing how accessible my hometown is. Meakstown and Charlestown resides in Finglas and it is home to a shopping centre, restaurants and kids who think they're funny by throwing their milkshake at you.
                
                
            <p>But, it is also home to one of the worst accessiblity specifically for people in wheelchairs as well as crutches. Featuring many cracks in the pavement, bus stops on hills as well as gates that are hard as hell to get through if you are disabled. 
                
                
            <p>Unfortunately (?), I am not disabled, so I can't comment on the cracks effectively, since I don't know how it feels. But quite fortunately, I could always rent a wheelchair and test it that way. And that I did. It cost...a lot. But it was worth it, I want to help advance Universal Design in my hometown. </p>
