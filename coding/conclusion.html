            <p>Oh, but there is way! So much way! But there is not a lot of way for disabled people in Meakstown. Ways to live comfortably. This is absolutely unacceptable to have the paths in such a state. It is incredibly unsafe and dangerous, and most of all, it's just a nuisance.
            I got used to it by the end, I have to admit, and that's when the state of the paths became a nuisance. And most of all, it almost damaged my wheelchair, and if I damaged it then I couldn't return it, and I'd have to pay more money to get it off my hands. If I ever met with an unfortunate accident and had to operate in a wheelchair I would be so mad.
            If we want disabled people in Meakstown's lives to improve, we need to fix all of the cracks in the universe it seems, so much sidewalk work must be completed. Ramps are there, but not very easy to find, or to traverse for the weak abled. We need proper signs indicating where ramps are as well as it being near the entrance, because people do not need to cross the Alps just to get into Dunnes.
            Once we fix these issues, wheelchair users will be able to live a comfortable life in Meakstown, but what if they need to leave? That means we need to move the bus stops in places that aren't sloped or tilted in any way so that people that are disabled don't have to hold on for dear life their emergency brake.
            Anyway, thanks for reading this website, if you need more information or have any queries, please consult the Contact Info page! :3</p>
